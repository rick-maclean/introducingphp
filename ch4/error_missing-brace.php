<h1>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h1>
<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy contains many weird and wonderful characters, including:</p>
<ul>
<?php
foreach ($characters as $name) {
echo "<li>$name</li>";
?>
</ul>
<p>I particularly like Slartibartfast, the planet builder from Magrathea who won an award for his work on the fjords of Norway.</p>
