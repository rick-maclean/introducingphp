=======================Checking the PHP configuration
server root

XAMPP
c:\xampp\htdocs 
 
  in here create introducingphp and setup folder then
 now create a file called config.php
 with only one line
<?php phpinfo(); ?>

 can see it in browser like this http://localhost/introducingphp/setup/config.php
 
 1) see php version at top
 2) Core section
 --display_errors should be on for local running but off for live version for security
 --error_reporting   should be at least 32767
 --magic_quotes_gpc  is not longer used
 
 ==============================Changing configuration settings
 in php.ini
 magic_quotes_gpc=Off should match the setting on the remote server (most likely is Off)
 
 error_reporting=E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT
 on a MAC he set it to this
 error_reporting=E_ALL | E_STRICT   this gets the value set to 32767

   Total 
   
   Always begins with $ 
   next no number
   only _ allowed

========================Displaying text and numbers
$firstName = 'Rick';
$firstName = 'Rick';
$total = 56;

echo $firstName, $total;

<?php 
$firstName = 'Rick';
$total = 56;
echo $firstName, $total;
print $firstName;
?>

// This is a comment that will be ignored by php 
# This is also a comment 
$firstName = 'David'; //This ia a single line comment
$lastName = 'Sring'; #comment
/* This ia a multiple line commentIs takes 
   on until */
