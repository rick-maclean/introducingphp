==================
XAMPP  has several things added to it. Runs on Windows and iOS and Linux???

1) Install XAMPP  (for minimal might not want FTP, Mercury, Tomcat, Webilizer, Fake Sendmail)
2) restart windows otherwise will not work correctly
3) remember PORTs are critical so cannot share them with other AMP stacks

4) Launch Control Panel : start Apache and MySQL (or stop)
5) in browser to http://localhost
   English
   phpinfo() versions
   Security : need passwords
   phpMyAdmin
   
6) Control Panel
  Netstat - which apps are using which ports
  Config Buttons
      see Aphachi httpd.conf, PHP php.ini, MySQL my.ini
  Explorer button : htdocs --web sites 
  
7) Security
   control panel Admin button -- Security  (need to fix this) (lock down so only local machine) 
   
   phpMyAdmin : no password so set password on security page

=====================================PORT CONFLICTS
windows run my services 
Control Panel: Administrative Tools : Services
I cannot see Apache or mySQL on it.
   
   Admin Command prompt
   netstat -a -o | find "LISTENING" | find ":80"
   result of this shows me the process # 9936 to see what applications are using this port
   Task Manager  in search and run it...I could not find 9936 hmmmmm
   
   SKYPE conflict
      tools options : advanced : connection (ports 80 and 443 for incoming...so unclick it, quit and restart it)
